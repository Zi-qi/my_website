title: An Empirical Study of German American Bancorp’s Acquisition of River Valley Bancorp
---
Abstract:
This paper uses event study methodology to analyse the merger effect on shareholders’ wealth of German American Bancorp and River Valley Bancorp in both the short term and long term. We adopt the market model for the short term and the Fama and French 3 Factor model as well as include liquidity factor for the long term study. The result shows German American Bancorp experienced -0.05million and River Valley Bancorp experienced 26.44million with a test window of five days prior and five days after the announcement date. The combined firm experienced 26.39million gains in the short term and insignificant returns in the long term. We use factors including macroeconomic background, industry environment, market power, synergy effect, and taxation to analyse the reasons for mergers. We also leverage complexity theory, focus or diversification, means of payment, number of bidders, agency theory, and ratio analysis to investigate wealth change for shareholders.
